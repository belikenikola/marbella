if you go back cd ..
you should be in grey-hill folder
in that folder we have
concord-hills
westminster
and now,
marbella

Create Marbella Landing page following the same patterns as concord hills and westminster, but add unique design twist.
Build application with Next.js.
Use canva-brochure content as guidlines and detailed informations.
Use marbella-assetss as image assetes for the web.
Use copy.md as base content, but expend and make it meaningful.
Site has to have wow effect, to be clean and easy to navigate,
it has to be a bit interactive and animated with framer motion.

Make sure to fullfil wcag 2.1 AA accesibility standards and create Accessibility page, also follow the pattern for Westminster and Concord hills in every sense.
We will use resend for the form, for now put some mock API, and I'll add the actual key when I get access to the domain.
